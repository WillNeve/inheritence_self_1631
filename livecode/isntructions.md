- Define an Animal with an initialize(name) constructor, exposing its name.
- Define three Lion, Meerkat and Warthog classes
- Implement a #talk instance method which returns a sentence like "Simba roars" for each animal. (Hint: Meerkats bark and Warthog grunt)
- In another Ruby file, create an array with Simba, Nala, Timon & Pumbaa, iterate over it and puts the sound each animal make
-Implement a class method which will return an array of a given species from an animal array.
- Add an #eat(food) instance method in Animal which returns a sentence like “Timon eats a scorpion”. Then override this method for the Lion class, and return a sentence like “Simba eats a gazelle. Law of the Jungle!”
